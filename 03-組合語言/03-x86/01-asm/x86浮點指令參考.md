* [SSE2 Instructions](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19120-01/open.solaris/817-5477/epmpv/index.html)

* addpd: add packed double-precision floating-point values 
* xorpd: perform bitwise logical XOR of packed double-precision floating-point values 
* cvtsi2sd: convert doubleword integer to scalar double-precision floating-point value 
* divsd: divide scalar double-precision floating-point values


In SSE, the 128 bits registers can be represented as 4 elements of 32 bits or 2 elements of 64 bits.

## packed 和 scalar 的不同

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16218665/simd-and-difference-between-packed-and-scalar-double-precision

SSE defines two types of operations; scalar and packed. Scalar operation only operates on the least-significant data element (bit 0~31 or 0~63), and packed operation computes all elements in parallel.

## SIMD Parallelism

* addpd — do 2 double-precision additions
* addps — do just one double-precision addition, using the low 64-bits of the register
* addsd — do 4 single-precision additions
* addss — do just one single-precision addition, using the low 32-bits of the register

## Saturated Arithmetic

The XMM registers can also do arithmetic on integers. The instructions have the form:

operation  xmmregister_or_memorylocation, xmmregister
For integer addition, the instructions are:

* paddb — do 16 byte additions
* paddw — do 8 word additions
* paddd — do 4 dword additions
* paddq — do 2 qword additions
* paddsb — do 16 byte additions with signed saturation (80..7F)
* paddsw — do 8 word additions with unsigned saturation (8000..7FFF)
* paddusb — do 16 byte additions with unsigned saturation (00..FF)
* paddusw — do 8 word additions with unsigned saturation (00..FFFF)
